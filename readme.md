# Become a Software Professional 2023
## week 02
the first week we worked on the landing page of our project in figma.
I had never worked with figma before but I found it a very interesting program and above all easy to learn.

## week 02
the second week we started writing code.
We had an explanation of git and an html class.
We also had the weekly problem of writing the html for the landing page designed by my group. 

## week 03
The third week we start with css.
For this we had a class on Thursday and a presentation of the weekly objective, which is to apply css to our html from the last problem.
I started applying corrections to my html, uploading the necessary images and icons and uploaded the reset.css file provided by the tutors.
From this point on i could start my own stylesheet to "copy" our design in figma.
