## week-02
the second week we started writing code.
We had an explanation of git and an html class.
We also had the weekly problem of writing the html for the landing page designed by my group.

## week-03
The third week we start with css.
For this we had a class on Thursday and a presentation of the weekly objective, which is to apply css to our
html from the last problem. I started applying corrections to my html, uploading the necessary images and icons and
uploaded the reset.css file provided by the tutors.
From this point on i could start my own stylesheet to "copy" our design in figma.

In the fourth week we learned and worked with flex-box.
We modularized the css for a better content distribution.
We learned about media queries and implemented them to comply with responsive design starting with the mobile
version and taking it to the tablet and deskopt versions.
finally, we implemented the use of the "git hub pages" tool.

## week-05

This week we started working on JavaScript, six exercises were presented and we were able to solve them with a large
amount of asynchronous material. I was able to consolidate previous knowledge and include the new ones provided by
this course.
I also had to correct things in the html and css, improve the neatness of the order of the elements make it a much
more friendly code.

## week-06

This week we apply JavaScript to our project, we use methods that allow us to obtain the values of the inputs to
validate its content with specific requirements.
I was able to strengthen my knowledge in JS as well as apply it to real situations.

This week we are working with the fetch method to fetch data to the api and validate it.
Also to store it in the local storage and to be able to deposit it in the inputs of the form.
We also added alerts that indicate us the data entered and if the process was successful or had an error.
